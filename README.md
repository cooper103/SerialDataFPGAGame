# SerialDataFPGAGame
This repository contains the source files for an FPGA game (and a few other modes) that utilizes serial data transfer. In the game mode, the user must press a button when the LED strip is green. After successive correct inputs, the difficult increases, and colors cycle faster. Incorrect inputs will restart the game. 

A basic description of the different features is given in BasicFunctionality.pdf, and details of each module are given in DetailedFunctionalDescription.pdf. A video demo is also included in the repository.
